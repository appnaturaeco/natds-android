# How to contribute - WIP

Are you feeling that you can help us with anything in the project? Just get closer!!

There are many ways to contribute, check some of them:
## Create an PR to contribute with the project
We will review your PR, checking some criteria and if everything is fine, a new version of the lib will be publish with your contribution ASAP!
As the PR goes through our review process, you can test your product with a snapshot generated from your development! 
For this to happen, it is necessary that the execution of the pull request pipeline is carried out successfully and the following code is added: 


**build.gradle** (root) :

    allprojects {
		repositories {
			...
			maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
		}
	}


**build.gradle** (app) :


    dependencies {
	     implementation 'com.github.natura-cosmeticos:natds-android:PR-000-XYZ-SNAPSHOT'
	}

The name of the dependency is variable according to the number and name of the branch of origin, but is always followed by the suffix "-SNAPSHOT"

### Commits structure
To commit your PR, we indicate the usage of [Conversional Commits] (https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).

The most common types the we use is:
Are you adding a new feature, your commit should look like: feat: [Short Description] [long description if you need]
Are you fixing a bug, your commit should look like: bug: [Short Description] [long description if you need]
Are you adding tests, your commit should look like: test: [Short Description] [long description if you need]

There are many other types that you can use to tag your commits: build:, chore:, ci:, docs:, style:, refactor:, perf:
[here you can find more info about it](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).

#### Tool to help:
You can add an CLI to help you writing your commits. [Commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli) is the tool we use :)
##### Install the CLI
```bash
npm install -g commitizen
```
###### Do your work and commit
```bash
git add .
git cz
```

Commitizen will guide you about how to structure you commit

### Review criteria
Fine, now you should be asking your self, which critearia will be checked? Here some of them:
- Your code is covered by tests
- Your code is well strcutured, respecting SOLID principals
- Your code passed our automatic verifications (you can check the pipeline flow link in your PR) - and you can run this flow localy (check here for more info)

Its important to check **read:packages** and when generating you password.

**Important:** The file **github_credentials.properties** can not be commited.

### Testing with Screenshots
We are using [Screenshot Tests for Android](https://github.com/facebook/screenshot-tests-for-android) to validate our built components state, color and behavior.

**Tip from library page to build tests for the first time**
It is necessary to have python-2.7 installed for the gradle plugin to work, and we also recommending installing the python-pillow library which is required for recording and verifying screenshots.

#### Prerequisites
1 - Install python-pillow
```
$ pip install mock
$ pip install Pillow
```

2 - Configure emulator with follow mandatory details:
```
CPU/ABI: Google Play Intel Atom (x86)
Target: google_apis_playstore [Google Play] (API level 29)
Skin: pixel_2
hw.lcd.width: 1080
hw.lcd.height: 1920
hw.initialOrientation: Portrait
image.androidVersion.api: 29
tag.id: google_apis_playstore
hw.lcd.density: 420
```

#### Recording and Verifying screenshots
```
$ ./gradlew recordDebugAndroidTestScreenshotTest
$ ./gradlew verifyDebugAndroidTestScreenshotTest
```
All new screenshots will be recorded on folder `screenshots\<device_folder>`

#### Executing integration tests
```
$ ./gradlew clean connectedAndroidTest
```

### How to create a new version
In the file **publish.gradle** update field in the method **getVersionName** with the new version number. Example, for the version 1.0.1:

    def getVersionName = { ->
        return "1.0.1"
    }
