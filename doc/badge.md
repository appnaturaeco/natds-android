## What is it?

The Badge is a screen element used to signal the user's points of attention.
Represents dynamic information such as number of notifications unread with some styles to match Nat DS appearance.

### Why should I use it?

This component can help you to display some simple information on the top of chosen drawable.

### When should I use it?

Every time you want to display an component with a badge

### How to use it?

We use BadgeDrawable class to draw this component on screen. 
For that to happen, it is necessary to instantiate the BadgeDrawable class, passing three parameters: 

1. context application
2. number that will be drawn
3. the drawable that will receive the badge
        
#### Examples

##### If you want to display an icon with a Badge with number

* Create a drawable layer-list with two items inside. The first item should be your base icon and the second should be the placeholder for your badge.

``` android
 icon_base_badge.xml
 
<layer-list xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">
    <item
        android:drawable="@drawable/outlined_default_mockup"
        android:gravity="center" />

    <item
        android:id="@+id/ic_badge_placeholder"
        android:drawable="@android:color/transparent" />
</layer-list>

   ```

* Use icon_base_badge.xml as your ImageView source.

* Create a new instance of BadgeDrawable passing the context, the number that you want to be displayed and the image will be inflated with Badge.

``` kotlin
    val badgeDrawable: BadgeDrawable

    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_badge)
        badgeDrawable = BadgeDrawable(this, number, imageViewBadged.drawable)
    }
   ```

* If you need to update the number inside a Badge, call the method 'updateNotificationBadge'
```kotlin
   badgeDrawable.updateBadgeDrawable(number)
   ```
